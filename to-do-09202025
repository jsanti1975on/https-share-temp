ðŸš€ Plan for Tomorrow â€” Enable VLAN 10 on RV340
1. RV340 Config (GUI)

Log into the RV340 web interface.

Go to: LAN â†’ VLAN Settings.

Edit VLAN 10:

IP Address (Gateway): 172.20.10.254/24

DHCP Server: Enabled, scope = 172.20.10.100 â€“ 172.20.10.200

Save & Apply.

ðŸ‘‰ This gives your VMs a proper gateway + DHCP leases on VLAN 10.

2. Switch Config (West & East)

Make sure your trunks are carrying VLAN 10 (already looks like they are).
Check each trunk interface:

switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,999
switchport trunk native vlan 999

3. vSphere Host Config

Edit your Port Group VM Network (VLAN 10).

Set VLAN ID = 10 (tagged).

Assign VMs that should live in the 172.20.10.0/24 network.

Keep VLAN999-Mgmt as untagged for ESXi/WLC management traffic.

4. Verification

From a VM on VLAN 10:

ipconfig /renew â†’ should pull an IP from the 172.20.10.0/24 scope.

Ping gateway 172.20.10.254.

Ping external (e.g., 8.8.8.8).

From your client machine â†’ join domain (DC at 172.20.10.100).

5. After Confirmation

Lock down VLAN 999 to only management devices (WLC, ESXi mgmt, switches).

All user traffic stays in VLAN 10.

âš¡ By tomorrow:
Weâ€™ll move VMs into VLAN 10, validate DHCP, and confirm routing out to the internet works while keeping VLAN 999 strictly for management.
