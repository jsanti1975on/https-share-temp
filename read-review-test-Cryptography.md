🎯 Plan: Script Development for Cryptography CTF Challenges
1. Goal

Leverage the 10 cryptography challenges from your course and transform them into hands-on CTF puzzles. Each challenge will be paired with a custom script (Python, Bash, or VBA) that simulates the encryption/encoding process. Players must write or run decoders to solve.

2. Challenge Breakdown → Script Plan
🔹 Challenge 1 (Hex to ASCII)

Script Idea: Provide ciphertext as a hex string.

Player Task: Write/use a script to decode.

Implementation:

hex_encoder.py → Takes plaintext and outputs hex.

Reverse engineering needed to solve.

🔹 Challenge 2 (URL Encoding)

Script Idea: Generate percent-encoded text.

Player Task: Decode using URL tools or urllib.parse.unquote().

Implementation:

url_encoder.py → Input string → Percent-encoded output.

🔹 Challenge 3 (Binary to ASCII)

Script Idea: Convert text into 8-bit binary strings.

Player Task: Decode with binary-to-text logic.

Implementation:

binary_encoder.py → Outputs space-separated binary values.

🔹 Challenge 4 (Decimal ASCII → Binary → Text)

Script Idea: Layered encoding (Decimal → Binary → Text).

Player Task: Identify and reverse transformations.

Implementation:

ascii_decimal.py → Converts to 48/49/32 codes, then binary.

🔹 Challenge 5 (Binary + Base64)

Script Idea: Encode text into binary then re-encode in Base64.

Player Task: Perform multiple decoding steps.

Implementation:

binary_base64.py → Double-encoding script.

🔹 Challenge 6 (Caesar/ROT cipher)

Script Idea: Apply Caesar shift with random offset.

Player Task: Use brute force or ROT decoder.

Implementation:

rot_cipher.py → Encrypts with ROT(n).

🔹 Challenge 7 (Monoalphabetic Substitution)

Script Idea: Map alphabet to scrambled version.

Player Task: Frequency analysis to decode.

Implementation:

substitution_cipher.py → Generates ciphered text.

🔹 Challenge 8 (Leetspeak 1337)

Script Idea: Replace characters with 1337 equivalents.

Player Task: Translate back.

Implementation:

leet_encoder.py → Converts text into leetspeak.

🔹 Challenge 9 (Polybius Square Variant V/C)

Script Idea: Implement 16×16 Polybius encoding.

Player Task: Decode V#C# tokens.

Implementation:

polybius_encoder.py → Output as V#C# ciphertext.

🔹 Challenge 10 (A1Z26 with 0=space)

Script Idea: Encode using A1Z26 scheme.

Player Task: Convert numbers back to letters.

Implementation:

a1z26_encoder.py → Outputs number string with separators.

3. Integration Into CTF

Hosting: Scripts + ciphertexts stored on GitHub repo (cryptography-ctf).

Deployment:

Provide encoded challenge files (challenge1.txt … challenge10.txt).

Players run decoders to retrieve plaintext flags.

Flag Format:

Use flag{decoded_phrase} standard.

Example: Challenge 9 → flag{IM_A_WILD_ANIMAL}

4. Tools & Environment

Language: Python 3 (main scripting).

Optional: Bash (simple encoding wrappers).

Delivery:

Docker image or VM (Parrot/Kali) preloaded with encoder scripts.

GitHub repo for open distribution.

5. Future Expansion

Add network-based CTF tasks: encode message, serve over Netcat, require client decode.

Incorporate VBA macro challenge (fits with your lab/Excel experience).

Build into a Capstone showcase:

“CTF challenge suite for cryptography & encoding fundamentals.”

✅ This plan maps each class cryptography challenge → script → CTF task.
📌 You’ll end up with a reusable CTF package that aligns directly with your Cybersecurity program.
