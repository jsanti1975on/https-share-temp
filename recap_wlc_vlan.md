# âœ… Recap: WLC + VLAN Integration

## ðŸ”¹ Current Lab State
- **East (ESXi-CLIENTS)** and **West (ESXi-SERV)** switches are configured with EtherChannel (Po1 trunk, Po2 ESXi uplinks).  
- VLANs in use:
  - **VLAN 10** = `172.20.10.0/24` (VM Data / Clients & Servers).  
  - **VLAN 999** = `10.10.99.0/24` (Mgmt / Native).  
- **Cisco RV340** routes between VLANs and provides DHCP.  
- **vSphere** host has:
  - `VLAN10` Port Group â†’ VMs get `172.20.10.x`.  
  - `VLAN999-Mgmt` Port Group â†’ VMs get `10.10.99.x`.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ WLC Status
- Management interface currently set to:
  - `10.10.99.10/24` on **VLAN999 (untagged)**.  
- **VM â†’ WLC (10.10.99.10)** pings work.  
- **WLC â†’ VM (10.10.99.x)** pings fail (normal WLC L2 mgmt behavior).  
- Web GUI confirmed working from VM (via `https://10.10.99.10`).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Observations
- WLC is **not a router** â€” its management interface is only for AP join / control / GUI.  
- It does not forward/route end-host traffic like a switch or router.  
- One-way ping (VM â†’ WLC) is expected and not a failure.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Options Going Forward
1. **Keep WLC on VLAN999**
   - Continue using `10.10.99.0/24` purely for management.  
   - Use VLAN10 for VM and wireless client data traffic.  
   - Accept that pings *from WLC to VMs* wonâ€™t work (but VM â†” WLC GUI is fine).  

2. **Migrate WLC Mgmt to VLAN10**
   - Move WLC management to `172.20.10.0/24`.  
   - Pings will work both directions.  
   - Simplifies integration with VMs and APs.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Current Decision Point
ðŸ‘‰ Right now, the WLC **works on 10.10.99.10** for GUI and mgmt.  
But if you want **cleaner integration with your ESXi servers and clients**, we should move WLC management to **VLAN10 (172.20.10.0/24)**.
